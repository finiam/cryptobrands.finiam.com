# Finiam Cryptobrands Website

A basic Eleventy app powered by Snowpack.

Just place `liquid` (templating language used by Shopify) or `md` files under `src` and they will get turn into HTML pages by Eleventy.

Write Javascript (Typescript please) and CSS under `src/assets`. Avoid CSS though and use Tailwind, compiles will be slow everytime you update the CSS.
